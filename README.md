Excavare
====================
As an aside, coding for this, initially toy project, began during a course I took during my senior year at Transylvania University. I am open to letting someone pick-up this project from where my partner and I left off, albeit sans compensation.

Imagine having 1000 unread documents in your workspace, each with 1000 pages of unread text. How quickly could you determine which page is most relevant to your investigation?
